# ACTIVECOVIDTRACKER

ACTIVE COVID TRACKER is an IoT based wrist band which is proposed to track the patients whether there is a possibility of reappearing corona to the cured patients or for the people who were released from several days of quarantined by monitoring their body temperature, the oxygen level in blood & pulse rate through the internet itself. 

WORKING:
we used ESP8266 12E microcontroller along with MAX30100 sensor for measuring pulse of the human body and oxygen level and a temperature sensor to measure temperature of human body, OLED DISPLAY to display the value measured, this ESP8266 12E is connected with UBIDOTS using wifi and we can connect to our mobile to monitor ourselves by use of blynk app, and like this large number of patients are connected using UBIDOTS and when there is a significant change in the heart beat or temperature or oxygen level a tigger will be sent to control room where they monitor all the patients discharged and they can evacuate the person from that place therby stopping the spread of covid-19 corona virus.
